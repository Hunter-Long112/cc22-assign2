I used the network yaml, then the server and storage yaml, that were provided by the professor to set up the "base architecture"
for this assignmnet. The storage and database yaml I wrote, to add the two mySQL servers to the network. 

I will update this read me in the near future with a detailed explanation on how I finished this assignment, and a bit of exploriation
through the infrastructure to show that everything is set up the way it should be. I will also upload the diagram of the architecture
soon.
